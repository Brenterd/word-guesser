# word-guesser
The Word Guesser project is an interactive game that tests players' ability to deduce and expand their vocabulary. The goal is to use a succession of hints the game provides to guess a concealed word. Players are encouraged to think strategically and participate by having a limited number of chances to guess the right word.
